# Design and Development Notes

## 1. General Questions

### 1.1 What Questions to Ask When Designing and Developing

- *Does this reflect the brand?*
- *Is this design user-friendly?*
- *Is it easy for a user to get the information they need?*
- *Is the code clean and maintainable?*
- *Will this project be easily updated?*
- *Is this site performant (does it load quickly)?*

## 2. Planning Stages of Project

### 2.1 Discovery and Goal Setting

**Define the "Why"** 

*What is the primary purpose of the project?*

**Identify the Target Audience**

*Who are you trying to reach?*

*What do you know about this audience?*

**Analyze the "Competition"**

*What do you like?*

*What can you do better?**

### 2.2 Scope and Feature Definition

**Content Strategy**

*What will you put in this project?*

**Feature List**

*What features will this project have (e.g. blog, contact form, gallery, etc...?*

**Technology Stack**

*What technologies will you use?*

*What will you use for styles?*

*If needed, what will you use for data handling?*

### 2.3 Inforamtion Architecture and User Flow

1. - [ ] **Sitemap:** Create a sitemap of all pages for the project and how they link together.
	- [ ] Define Information Heirachy
	- [ ] Map links

2. - [ ] **Wireframes:** Sketch out basic layout

3. - [ ] **Userflow:** Map out paths the user will take through the project 

[See](##3.-Information-Heirarchy)

### 2.4 Design and Development

**Visual Design** 

- [ ] Color Schema
- [ ] Typography
- [ ] Aesthetic
- [ ] Mood Board
- [ ] Style Guide
- [ ] Component Definitions


[See](###5.-Visual-Design-Systems)

**Development**

### 2.5 Launch and Maintenance

**Deployment:** Push code and make site live

**Maintenance:** Keep up to date and monitored

---

## 3. Information Heirarchy

### 3.1 Workflow for Determining Information Heirarchy

1. - [ ] **List all the content:** Start by listing every piece of information you want on the site

2. - [ ] **Group related content:** Group items on list in logical categories which will in-turn become the pages or sections of the site

3. - [ ] **Prioritize Content:** Arrange content on each page in order of importance - most important at top.

### 3.2 Portfolio Example

1. **Homepage:**
	- Name
	- Headline describing what you do
	- A Call to action (e.g. "View My Work" and "Get in Touch")

2. **About Page**
	- Background and Experience
	- Skills and Expertise
	- Resume (document form)

3. **Portfolio / Work Page:** For each work featured:
	- Title
	- Date 
	- Documentation link (if applicable)
	- Technologies Used
	- Link to active project or source code

4. **Contact Page:**

## 4. User Flow

1. - [ ] **Identify the User Persona:** Who are the different types of user visiting the site?

2. - [ ] **Define User Persona's Goals:** What is each user trying to accomplish?

3. - [ ] **Map out their "User Journey":** For each persona, map out the steps they will take to achieve their goal.

## 5. Visual Design Systems

### 5.1 Layout and Composition

This section highlights the **Major Considerations** with any project:

- **Grid System or Flex** Traditional 12-column grid or something else?
- **Whitespace (Negative Space)** Ue empty space between elements to improve readabilty
- **Visual Heirarchy** How do you guide the user's eye? This can be achieved by use of size, color, contrast and placement

### 5.2 Imagery and Media
Images and media will aid in impact

- **Photography vs Illustration**
- **Iconography** What style and source of icons will you use to communicate inforamtion and user flow?
- **Video and Animation**

### 5.3 Spacing and Proximity

Spacing of elements impacts how they are perceived.

- **Proximity** Elements close together are related
- **Padding and Margins** Create logical distance between elements and groups

### 5.4 Visual Effects and Details

- **Shadows and Depth** Make elements feel more tangible
- **Borders and Lines** Help with separation and create visual interest
- **Effects** Aid in suggestion of user flow, provide information back to the user, and engage the user.

## 6. Development

- [ ] **Transfer information heirarchies into models, arrays, objects, etc.
- [ ] **Transform Aesthetic Choices into Styles
