# Information Hierarchy & Sitemap Checklist

This checklist outlines the steps for defining a website or application's information architecture, from initial content gathering to creating a final sitemap.

---

### Phase 1: Content Inventory & Discovery

*   [ ] **List All Content:** Create a comprehensive spreadsheet or document listing every single piece of content that will appear on the site.
*   [ ] **Audit Existing Content (if applicable):** Review any existing content for relevance, accuracy, and quality. Decide what to keep, revise, or delete.
*   [ ] **Identify Content Gaps:** Based on project goals, determine if any necessary content is missing and needs to be created.

### Phase 2: Grouping and Labeling

*   [ ] **Prepare for Card Sorting:** Write each item from the content inventory onto a separate card or digital sticky note.
*   [ ] **Conduct Card Sorting Sessions:** Have users group the cards into piles that make sense to them.
    *   [ ] Session 1 (with User Group A)
    *   [ ] Session 2 (with User Group B)
    *   [ ] Session 3 (with User Group C)
*   [ ] **Analyze Card Sorting Results:** Identify common patterns, groupings, and labels that emerged from the sessions.
*   [ ] **Define Final Categories:** Based on the analysis, establish the primary navigation categories and their labels.

### Phase 3: Structure and Sitemap

*   [ ] **Choose a Hierarchy Pattern:** Decide on the primary structure (e.g., Hierarchical, Sequential, Matrix) that best fits the content and user goals.
*   [ ] **Draft a Sitemap:** Create a visual diagram or outline that shows the structure of pages and how they relate to each other.
    *   [ ] Version 1 (Initial Draft)
    *   [ ] Version 2 (Refined based on feedback)
*   [ ] **Define URL Structure:** Plan a clean and logical URL structure that mirrors the sitemap hierarchy.
*   [ ] **Review and Finalize Sitemap:** Get feedback from stakeholders and finalize the sitemap, which will serve as the blueprint for the design and development phases.

### Phase 4: Page-Level Hierarchy

*   [ ] **Prioritize Content on Key Pages:** For each main page, rank the content elements in order of importance to the user.
*   [ ] **Sketch Basic Wireframes:** Create low-fidelity layouts that reflect the established page-level hierarchy.
